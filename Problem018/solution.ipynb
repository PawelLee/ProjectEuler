    "We start with the first vertex in topological order. We want to visit all the reachable nodes and store the weight of the edge in the dictionary ```dist``` which maps each vertex in this graph to the total \"distance\" to it. Once we have visited all the edges we move to the next vertex in the order and visit all of its edges to calculate the distances to them (we add the value of the current vertex to the weight of the edge). For distances to vertices that we have already visited we only update ```dist``` if the newly calculated value is greater than the one stored. We repeat the process for all the vertices in the graph and then find the greatest value corresponding to a vertex in the final row i.e. the bottom of the pyramid (since there are no negative values in this graph this is equivalen to simply finding the highest value in ```dist```."
